NAME
    gist - Create a GitHub Gist from the current file

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    The `:GistCreate` command creates a GitHub Gist from the buffer selection using the `gh` command-line tool.
    The `:GistCreateFile` command creates a GitHub Gist from the current file using the `gh` command-line tool.
    The `:GistsList` command lists all the GitHub Gists from your account and allows you to edit them directly inside neovim.

    The plugin prompts you for a description and privacy settings for the Gist creation, and then copies the URL of the created Gist to the system clipboard.

        :GistCreateFile [description] [public=true]

    The plugin will prompt you for a description and privacy settings for the Gist.
    After you enter the description and privacy settings, the plugin will ask for confirmation and create the Gist using the `gh` command-line tool and copy the URL of the created Gist to the system clipboard.
